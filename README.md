# Books-Recommender-System
Hello everyone! This is my pet-project, aim of which is to gain knowledge about recommender systems. In this project I will use Book-Crossing User Review ratings dataset, which contains from Users, Books, User-Review files. Links to files: Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/bookcrossing-dataset/ , webpage - http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/ . I am creating this repository before I start actually working, so I can upload my work step-by-step, and you actually can see how the whole process went, + I want to get crooked line as my gitflow (haha). I am not guru in building Recommender systems, so work may have some errors, misinterpretations. If you notice one, feel free to wrtie me to: ssamatuly01@gmail.com about it. Hope you will enjoy this work.
