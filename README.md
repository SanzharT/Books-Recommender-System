Hello everyone! This is my pet-project, aim of which is to gain knowledge about recommender systems. In this project I will use Book-Crossing User Review ratings dataset, which contains Users, Books, User-Review files.

I am creating this repository before I start actually working, so I can upload my work step-by-step, and you actually can see how the whole process went, + I want to get crooked line as my gitflow (haha). I am not guru in building Recommender systems, so work may contain some errors, misinterpretations. If you notice one, feel free to wrtie me to: ssamatuly01@gmail.com about it. Hope you will enjoy this work.
